# 👋🏻 Hi, we're AbilityLine!

## Welcome to AbilityLine

Taking care of family members with disabilities is a demanding 24-hour job. It requires expertise that most family members do not have and can beextremely stressful.

AbilityLine is a supportive online community of family members, therapists, and professional caretakers, as well as a huge database of internal and external information. Family member caretakers can get advice from each other and receive counselling from therapists that are suited just for their need.
